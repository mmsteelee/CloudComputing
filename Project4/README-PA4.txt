README-PA3

Team 10

Milestone 1:

split up provided energy data into 3 parts, 
and wrote producer code corresponding to each file for each team member to use

Effort expended:
- the delay in completing PA3 factored into this milestone being completed, as our issue involved
	our pipeline not being complete, and data not being stored in couchdb
- once that issue was resolved, milestone 1 was very simple

Teamwork:
- Matt: wrote the producer code for each team member, and split up the energy data into 3 csv files
- Austin: recorded the demo video
- Brett: N/A
