# This playbook is our demo master file
# The goal is to show how to have a single master file which then
# includes multiple plays according to some well-designed choreography
#
# This file is similar to the one in the AnsibleOnly_Local_and_Cloud folder
# For now I just kept one play in here but feel free to add more.

### Play 1: Create VMs

# Here I show the use of import_tasks from child playbooks
