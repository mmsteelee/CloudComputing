# This is a sample inventory file used for Ansible. You can name your
# inventory file to whatever you want.  Make sure that you reference
# the correct inventory file in your .ansible.cfg file.
#
# Here I have defined an alias to refer to my local VM (in which I will run
# the ansible playbook).  These aliases will be referenced in the playbooks.
# Every local machine can be accessed using either localhost or 127.0.0.1
# IP address. Moreover, we tell Ansible, that the connection type to the
# local VM is via local connection.  Note that how you name the alias
# is up to you. I just called it MyLocalVMs
#

127.0.0.1  ansible_connection=local

# Below I define my currently allocated VMs in the Chameleon Cloud and
# their floating IP addresses. Just make sure to use that alias in your
# playbooks.  Here, since we are going to communicate remotely with
# a cloud-based VM, the connection type used by ansible will be ssh,
# and we tell Ansible the location of our ssh private key.

# The following will need to be changed by the user (their floating IP on chameleon and the full name and location of the pem file)
